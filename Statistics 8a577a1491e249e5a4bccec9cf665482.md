## **1. What is a vector in mathematics?**

A vector is a mathematical construct that has both magnitude and direction. It is commonly represented as an ordered set of numbers.

## **2. How is a vector different from a scalar?**

A scalar has only magnitude, whereas a vector has magnitude and direction. Vectors are represented by arrows, whereas scalars are represented by simply integers or values.

## **3. What are the different operations that can be performed on vectors?**

Vector addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product are common vector operations.

## **4. How can vectors be multiplied by a scalar?**

Multiply each component of the vector by the scalar.

## **5. What is the magnitude of a vector?**

The magnitude is the length of the vector and is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

## **6. How can the direction of a vector be determined?**

A vector's direction is determined by the angles it makes with the coordinate axes.

## **7. What is the difference between a square matrix and a rectangular matrix?**

A square matrix has the same number of rows and columns as a rectangular matrix, but the row and column counts differ.

## **8. What is a basis in linear algebra?**

A basis is a set of vectors that spans a vector space, and any vector in that space can be uniquely represented as a linear combination of the basis vectors.

### ****9. What is a linear transformation in linear algebra?****

A linear transformation is a function that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication between two vector spaces.

### **10. What is an eigenvector in linear algebra?**

A square matrix eigenvector is a non-zero vector that continues in the same direction after the matrix is applied.

### ****11. What is the gradient in machine learning?****

The gradient is a vector of partial derivatives that points in the direction of a function's steepest increase.

### **12. What is backpropagation in machine learning?**

Backpropagation is a supervised learning technique that adjusts weights to minimise error when training artificial neural networks.

### **13. What is the concept of a derivative in calculus?**

A derivative represents a function's rate of change with regard to its independent variable.

### **14. How are partial derivatives used in machine learning?**

A function's derivative represents its instantaneous rate of change with regard to its input. It determines how sensitive the function output is to changes in the input. The slope of the tangent line to the function curve at that point is the derivative at that position.

### **15. What is probability theory?**

Probability theory is an area of mathematics that deals with the likelihood of occurrences in a given set of outcomes.

### **16. What are the primary components of probability theory?**

Sample space, events, probability measures, and random variables are the essential components.

### **17. What is conditional probability, and how is it calculated?**

The chance of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred is known as conditional probability. It is computed by dividing the likelihood of the intersection by the likelihood of the conditioning event.

### **18. What is Bayes theorem, and how is it used?**

The Bayes theorem is a formula that calculates the likelihood of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that may be associated with the event. It is frequently used to update probabilities in statistics and machine learning.

### **19. What is a random variable, and how is it different from a regular variable?**

A random variable is one whose possible values are the results of a random phenomenon. It varies from a conventional variable in that its value is random.

### **20. What is the law of large numbers, and how does it relate to probability theory?**

According to the law of large numbers, as the number of trials in a random experiment rises, the sample mean converges to the expected value, resulting in a consistent prediction of future outcomes. It is a basic idea in probability theory.

### **21. What is the central limit theorem, and how is it used?**

The central limit theorem says that, regardless of the original distribution, the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution. It is used to draw conclusions regarding population parameters.

### **22. What is the difference between discrete and continuous probability distributions?**

Discrete distributions deal with countable outcomes, while continuous distributions involve uncountable outcomes. Discrete probability functions are defined for individual points, while continuous distributions are described by probability density functions.

### **23. What are some common measures of central tendency, and how are they calculated?**

The mean, median, and mode are all common measures. The mean is calculated by adding all of the values and dividing by the count; the median is the middle value in a sorted dataset; and the mode is the most common value.

### **24. What is the purpose of using percentiles and quartiles in data summarization?**

Percentiles and quartiles divide data into portions and provide information about its distribution. The median represents the 50th percentile; quartiles divide data into four sections to indicate spread and skewness.

### **25. How do you detect and treat outliers in a dataset?**

Outliers are identified using statistical techniques (for example, Z-scores or interquartile range). Removal, transformation, and the use of robust statistical approaches are among treatment alternatives.

### **26. How do you use the central limit theorem to approximate a discrete probability distribution?**

The central limit theorem is implemented by periodically sampling from the discrete distribution, calculating means, and seeing the distribution of those means converging to a normal distribution.

### **27. How do you test the goodness of fit of a discrete probability distribution?**

Chi-square tests are often used to compare observed and expected frequencies, assessing if the distribution fits the data.

### **29. How do you calculate the joint probability distribution?**

Calculate the probability of the intersection of events for each combination of variables.

### **30. What is the difference between a joint probability distribution and a marginal probability distribution?**

Joint probability considers numerous factors, whereas marginal probability considers only one variable and ignores the others.

### **31. What is the covariance of a joint probability distribution?**

Covariance is a measure of how two random variables change in tandem. The expected product of departures from the mean is used to calculate it.

### **32. How do you determine if two random variables are independent based on their joint probability distribution?**

The variables are independent if the joint probability is the product of the marginals.

### **33. What is the relationship between the correlation coefficient and the covariance of a joint probability distribution?**

The correlation coefficient is a normalized version of covariance that represents the degree and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

The central limit theorem ensures that the sample mean distribution is approximately normal, allowing the use of parametric statistical methods regardless of the population distribution.

### **37. What is the difference between parameter estimation and hypothesis testing?**

Estimating population characteristics is what parameter estimation is all about, whereas hypothesis testing determines whether a given hypothesis about a parameter is correct.

### **38. What is the p-value in hypothesis testing?**

The p-value is the likelihood of getting the observed results  if the null hypothesis is true. A lower p-value indicates that there is more evidence against the null hypothesis.

A confidence interval is a set of values that can be used to estimate the true value of a population parameter with a high degree of certainty.

### **40. What are Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing?**

Type I error occurs when a valid null hypothesis is rejected; type II error arises when a false null hypothesis is not rejected.

### **41. What is the difference between correlation and causation?**

Correlation suggests that two variables are related, whereas causation implies that one variable causes the other.

### **42. How is a confidence interval defined in statistics?**

A confidence interval is a band of values surrounding a point estimate that, with a certain level of certainty, contains the real population parameter.

### **43. What does the confidence level represent in a confidence interval?**

The confidence level is the proportion of intervals from an unlimited number of samples that include the real population parameter.

The dot product of two vectors is the product of their magnitudes and the cosine of the angle between them. Geometrically, it quantifies the projection of one vector onto another.

### **52. What is the geometric interpretation of the cross-product?**

When two vectors are cross-product, a third vector is formed that is perpendicular to the plane defined by the original vectors. Its magnitude represents the area of the vector-formed parallelogram.

### **53. How are optimization algorithms with calculus used in training deep learning models?**

Optimization algorithms employ calculus to minimize or maximize a cost function, iteratively modifying model parameters to improve performance during deep learning model training.

### **54. What are observational and experimental data in statistics?**

Observational data is collected without intervention, whereas experimental data is obtained through controlled experiments in which factors are altered to evaluate their effects.

### **55. How are confidence tests and hypothesis tests similar? How are they different?**

Both require statistical testing in order to draw conclusions about populations. Confidence tests offer an interval estimate, whereas hypothesis tests analyze individual parameter assumptions.

### **56. What is the left-skewed distribution and the right-skewed distribution?**

The tail is longer on the left in a left-skewed (negatively skewed) distribution. The tail is longer on the right in a right-skewed (positively skewed) distribution.

### **57. What is Bessel’s correction?**

To produce unbiased estimates of population variance and covariance, Bessel's correction is applied to the sample variance and covariance.

### **58. What is kurtosis?**

The "tailedness" of a probability distribution is measured by kurtosis. When compared to a normal distribution, positive kurtosis suggests heavy tails and negative kurtosis shows light tails.

### **59. What is the probability of throwing two fair dice when the sum is 5 and 8?**

To get a total of 5, add the following numbers: (1, 4), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 1). To get a total of 8, add the following numbers: (2, 6), (3, 5), (4, 4), (5, 3), (6, 2). There are four positive outcomes for 5 and five positive outcomes for 8. The total number of possibilities is 6 * 6 = 36. As a result, the chance is (4 + 5)/36.

### **60. What is the difference between Descriptive and Inferential Statistics?**

Inferential statistics produce predictions or conclusions about a population based on a sample, whereas descriptive statistics summarize and describe data.

### **61. Imagine that Jeremy took part in an examination. The test has a mean score of 160, and it has a standard deviation of 15. If Jeremy’s z-score is 1.20, what would be his score on the test?**

Apply the following formula: Score = Mean + (Z-score * Standard Deviation) = 160 + (1.20 * 15).

### **62. In an observation, there is a high correlation between the time a person sleeps and the amount of productive work he does. What can be inferred from this?**

A strong correlation indicates a link between sleep and productivity, but it does not prove causality. Other things may influence productivity.

### **63. What is the meaning of degrees of freedom (DF) in statistics?**

The number of values or quantities in a statistical computation that are free to change is represented by degrees of freedom.

### **64. If there is a 30 percent probability that you will see a supercar in any 20-minute time interval, what is the proba­bility that you see at least one supercar in the period of an hour (60 minutes)?**

Use the complement rule: P(at least one supercar) = 1 - P(no supercar in any interval)^(60/20).

### **65. What is the empirical rule in Statistics?**

According to the empirical rule, also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule, in a normal distribution, about 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation, 95% within two, and 99.7% within three.

### **66. What is the relationship between sample size and power in hypothesis testing?**

Increasing sample size often improves statistical power, increasing the likelihood of discovering a real effect.

### **67. Can you perform hypothesis testing with non-parametric methods?**

Yes, non-parametric approaches such as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test can be employed for hypothesis testing when normality assumptions are not fulfilled.

### **68. What factors affect the width of a confidence interval?**

The confidence level, sample size, and variability are all factors to consider.

### **69. How does increasing the confidence level affect the width of a confidence interval?**

Increasing the confidence level broadens the interval by including more extreme values.

### **70. Can a confidence interval be used to make a definitive statement about a specific individual in the population?**

A confidence interval, not a conclusive declaration about an individual, offers a range of values for a population parameter.

### **71. How does sample size influence the width of a confidence interval?**

Increased data reduces uncertainty and provides more exact estimates of the population parameter, resulting in smaller confidence ranges.

### **72. What is the relationship between the margin of error and confidence interval?**

The margin of error is calculated to be half the breadth of the confidence interval. The confidence interval narrows as the margin of error shrinks, showing improved accuracy.

### **73. Can two confidence intervals with different widths have the same confidence level?**

No, confidence level is directly related to the width of the interval. Different widths correspond to different levels of confidence.

### **74. What is a Sampling Error and how can it be reduced?**

Sampling error is the difference between a sample statistic and the true population parameter. It can be reduced by increasing the sample size, ensuring random sampling, and minimizing bias.

### **75. What is a Chi-Square test?**

A Chi-Square test is a statistical test that is used to examine whether or not there is a significant relationship between categorical variables. It compares observed and anticipated frequency distributions.

### **76. What is a t-test?**

A t-test is a statistical test that is used to assess whether or not there is a significant difference in the means of two groups. When sample numbers are small or the population standard deviation is unknown, it is frequently used.

### **77. What is the ANOVA test?**

The ANOVA test is performed to see if there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent groups.

### **78. How is hypothesis testing utilized in A/B testing for marketing campaigns?**

In A/B testing, hypothesis testing entails comparing the performance of two versions (A and B) to see if there is a statistically significant difference, which assists marketers in making educated judgements regarding adjustments.

### **79. What is the difference between one-tailed and two tailed t-tests?**

A one-tailed t-test determines if the mean is substantially larger or lower than a given number. A two-tailed t-test determines if the mean differs substantially from a particular value, independent of direction.

### **80. What is an inlier?**

An outlier is an observation that does not fit into the overall trend of the data. It is not an anomaly and has no bearing on the broader trend or study.
